# 3D-Printer-Project

The IoT-Enabled Integrated 3D Scanning and Printing System elevates the traditional 3D scanning and 
printing experience by incorporating cutting-edge IoT concepts and leveraging advanced wireless 
connectivity through access technologies. This project seamlessly integrates a 3D scanner and a 3D 
printer(FDM-CNC type machine) into a unified system, utilizing components such as stepper motors, 
Arduino, Sharp infrared sensor, ESP32 DEVKIT V1 and ESP-01 ESP8266 Wi Fi Module connectivity, and 
Firebase for secure data storage. The primary focus is to provide users with an enhanced, connected, and 
intelligent 3D creation solution for educational exploration, prototyping, and personal projects.
